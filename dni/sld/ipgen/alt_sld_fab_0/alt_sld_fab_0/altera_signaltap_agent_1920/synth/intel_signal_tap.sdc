# TimeQuest constraints to constrain the timing across asynchronous clock domain crossings.
# The idea is to minimize skew to between stp_status_bits_in_reg_acq (acq domain) and stp_status_bits_out_reg_tck (tck domain)
# 
# CDC takes place between these paths (in intel_stp_status_bits_cdc component)

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This procedure constrains the max_delay (not skew) between the status bit regs.

# The hierarchy path to the status_bits CDC instance is required as an
